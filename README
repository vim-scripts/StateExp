The main point this script targets to is to ease writing code. Just type sw<ctrl-s> and you get a complete switch(){case;break;}  statement. 
But it can also be used to add a header to a letter, etc. What to expand and how to expand can easily be configured.          
                                                                    
To invoke the statement expansion, type a short form of a statement and press <ctrl-s> in insert mode.                        
  Memory aid: s (s)tatement expansion                               
The statement will be expanded. By default the most important C statements are defined. 
                                                                    
Press <leader>sh to get a list of defined statements.
